<p> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        With this software 
        you can investigate how an aircraft wing produces 
        lift and drag by changing the values of different factors 
        that produce aerodynamic forces.

<p>
            There are several different versions of FoilSim III which
            require different levels of experience with the package,
            knowledge of aerodynamics, and computer technology.
            This web page contains the off-line university version of the program.
            It includes an off-line user's manual which describes the
            various options available in the program. 
            More experienced users can select a
            <a href="Foil.html">version</a> of the program which does not include
            these instructions and loads faster on your computer.

       <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
           This program is designed to be interactive, so you have to work with the program.
           There are a variety of choices which you must make regarding the analysis and the display
           of results. There are two main input devices used to make a choice, a <b>push button</b>
           or a <b>drop menu</b>. To operate a button, move the cursor over the button and
           left click with the mouse. The push buttons occur in groups, and the chosen option is 
           shown as a <b>yellow</b>, "lighted" button.
           The drop down menu has a descriptive word displayed and an arrow at the right of the
           box. To make a choice, left click on the arrow, hold down and drag to
           make your selection.
           The current values of the design variables are presented to you in boxes. 
           By convention, a white box with
           black numbers is an input box and you can change the value of the number. A black box with
           yellow numbers is an output box and the value is computed by the program.
           To change the value in an input box, select the box by moving the cursor into the box
           and clicking the mouse, then backspace over the old number, enter a new number,
           then hit the <b>Enter</b> key on your keyboard. <b>You must hit Enter
           to send the new value to the program.</b>
           For most input variables you can also use a slider located next to the input box.
           Click on the slider bar, hold down and drag the slider bar to change values, or
           you can click on the arrows at either end of the slider.
           At any time, to return to the original default conditions,
           click the red <b>Reset</b> button at the upper right of the program.
</p>
<p>
           If you see only a grey box at the top of this page, be sure that Java is
           enabled in your browser. If Java is enabled, and you are using the Windows XP
           operating system, you need to get a newer version of Java. Go to this link:
           <a href="http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp</a>,
           try the "Download It Now" button, and then select "Yes" when the download box from Sun
           pops up.
</p>
<p>
           If you experience difficulties when using the sliders to change variables,
           simply click away from the slider and then back to it.</font>

          You can move the picture within the window by moving the cursor into 
          the window, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging the airfoil 
          to a new location. You can also "Zoom" in close to the airfoil by using 
          the green slider at the left of the window. If you get lost, pushing

        You select the type of output by using the push buttons
        on the control panel. The default setting is <b>Plot</b> and 
        a graph will appear in the window. The type of graph is described
        below and you can vary the plot by using the <b>Plot Selection</b> input panel.
        If you display a plot and begin to change the 
        input variables, it may become necessary to rescale the plot axes by 
        pushing the white <b>Rescale </b> button at the lower left of the window. 
        The types of available plots are 
        listed below and selcted from an Input Panel. </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The default plot 
          is the <b>Surface Pressure</b>. The yellow line will be a plot of the

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Probe </b> 
          lets you explore the flow around the wing. A probe control panel appears
          in the output window when you select "Probe" from the control panel.
          By default, the probe is 
          turned off. You turn the probe on by pushing one of the white buttons 
          on the probe panel. The probe itself will then appear in the view window. You 
          change the location of the probe using the sliders to the left and below 
          the gauge on the probe panel. The value of the pressure or the velocity at the location 
          of the probe tip (magenta ball on the view window) is displayed on the 
          gauge. Or a green trail of "smoke" is swept downstream from the probe

        Some additional output 
        from the program is displayed on the control panel and some input panels. 
        You can choose to display the lift or the lift 
        coefficient by using the drop menu on the control panel. Similarly, you
        can either display the drag or the drag coefficient. The value 
        is displayed in the output box to the right of the drop menu. Lift and drag 
        may be expressed in either Imperial (English) or metric units (pounds or Newtons). 
        On the Flight Test input panel is a group of output boxes that give the 
        atmospheric conditions of the air. The pressure, 
        temperature, density, and viscosity will change depending on the altitude 
        and planetary inputs. On the Size input panel the geometric <b>aspect ratio</b> of the 
        wing is displayed. The aspect ratio is defined to be the square of the 
        span divided by the wing area 
        and is included in the calculation of induced drag. The Reynold's number is the
        ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and affects the calculated value of the drag

        the Size, or perform a Flight Test of a wing design. You can also display 
        the Plot Selection Panel and a panel to control the Analysis used in FoilSim III. 
        </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose to 
          <b>Flight Test</b>, you can change the value of 
          lift by varying the speed, or the altitude. 
          You can flight test your wing on the earth (default), on Mars, or in 
          the water by using the choice box at the upper right. You can also 
          choose to specify your own values of temperature and pressure for air, 
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose <b>Shape</b>, 
          you can select a Joukowsky airfoil shape (J-foil), an ellipse, or a thin plate 
          cross section by using the choice box. You can change the <b>camber, 
          thickness, </b>or the <b>angle of attack</b> of 
          the cross section. The definitions of these geometric variables are given 
          on the wing geometry web page. There are some push buttons on the airfoil Shape
          input panel to let you chose some "basic" airfoil shapes: symmetric airfoil, flat bottom foil,
          negative camber, flat plate, high camber, curved plate, or ellipse. Clicking on these
          buttons will set a representative value of camber, thickness, and angle of attack.
          You can  
          choose to investigate the lift created by a rotating 
          cylinder, or a spinning ball. For these 
          problems you must specify the <b>spin rate and radius</b> and the
          <b>span</b> of the cylinder. </font></li>
          or to specify your own fluid by providing a value of the fluid density.</font></li>

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose <b>Size</b>, 
          you can vary the layout of the wing. You can change the <b>chord, span, 
          </b>or the wing <b>area</b>. The ratio of the span to the chord
           is called the <b>Aspect Ratio</b> and this parameter has an effect
           on the lift and drag of the wing. If you have selected 
           a cylinder or ball shape, this input panel is not used. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a variety
          of <b>Analysis</b> options in FoilSim III. The option being used is shown
          by a yellow lighted button on the Analysis panel. You can change the analysis
           by clicking on a white button. The default lift calculation includes a
           <b>Stall Model</b> that decreases the lift for angles of attack greater than
           10 degrees. The option is to use the <b>Ideal Flow</b> analysis that neglects
           viscous and compressibility effects. The actual calculations are done with ideal 
           flow and the stall model corrects for flow separation at high angles of attack.
           The actual calculation is done for a two-dimensional foil. The <b>Aspect Ratio</b> 
           correction includes the 3D wing tip effects on lift. The <b>Induced Drag</b> correction
           includes the 3D wing tips effects on drag. The drag is determined by a table look-up 
           for experimentally determined values of drag coefficient. The values were obtained at 
           a specific Reynold's number. The <b>Reynolds number correction</B> includes 
           the effects of changing Reynolds number to the test conditions.

FoilSimU includes all of the options of the original
FoilSim III plus some additional input and output panels.
These panels are made available so that you can study the details of the
<b>conformal mapping</b>
used in the Kutta-Joukowski analysis.
In the analysis, flow around a cylinder is mapped into
flow around an airfoil. Using the <b>Input push buttons</b>
on the control panel,
you can display a <b>Generating Plane</b> input panel.
The panel contains four input variables which
control the size and location of the generating cylinder
relative to the poles of the transformation, and the
strength of the point vortex
which is embedded in the airfoil.
According to the
<b>Kutta condition</b> of the analysis,
the strength of the vortex is
set to bring the aft stagnation point to the trailing edge.
With this version of FoilSim, you can turn the Kutta condition
off by using the <b>Analysis</b> panel to
study the effect.
A graph of the flow in the generating cylinder plane is
also available using the
<b>Plot Selection</b> input panel.

      <ol>
         <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>17 Feb 11</b>,
          version 1.4c was released.  This version modifies the plotting package
