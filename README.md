# FoilSim3JavaStandalone
Port of NASA's FoilSim III project from a Java applet to standalone Java. While it's easy to add a main method to an applet, and add the applet panel to a Frame, and thus make it runnable and displayable as an application, this is not generally sufficient. The reason is that browsers provide some extra infrastucture for applets to use. To help with this, Jef Poskanzer has written a very useful adapter class called MainFrame which helps provide this infrastructure.
